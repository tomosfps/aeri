## Using Aeri

1.  Use the `.env.example` to create an `.env` file (Ensure the `.env` is within the root of the project)
2.  Once setup the `.env` file, ensure you have both Docker, Docker Compose and NodeJS installed for your system
3.  Install pnpm `npm install -g pnpm`
4.  Run `pnpm all` and allow it to create and launch everything, seamlessly.
